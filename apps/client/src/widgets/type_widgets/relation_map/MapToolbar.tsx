 * three buttons that floated above the note. The readout between the steps says the scale the way
 * those do — a hundred being the map drawn at its own size — and pressed, takes the map back there
 * and to the corner it started in, which is what the button wearing a crop mark did.
 *

/**
 * The editing actions, standing in the middle of the map's foot on a group of their own — adding a
 * note today, with room along the row for whatever editing the map comes to offer next.
 *
 * A group of its own rather than more buttons on {@link MapToolbar}, as on the geo map: that one is
 * the camera — how close in the map is drawn and where it stands — and what changes the map is
 * another kind of thing. The middle of the foot is where the geo map's editing stands too, and it
 * keeps the two apart at any width: a group pinned to the corner opposite would meet the camera on a
 * narrow pane. Beside it in this module rather than in one of its own, as the mind map's two bars
 * are: a group of one button is not a file's worth, and the two are read together.
 *
 * Adding a note is the one thing this map is edited by, so the button carries its name in words
 * rather than standing as a bare glyph, as the geo map's does. It wears the mark a note wears — the
 * very thing a press drops on the map, as the geo map's + wears the pin it drops — rather than the
 * folder-and-plus it wore among the floating buttons: a folder is what a note wearing no mark of
 * its own is drawn as once it has children (see `getNoteIcon` in commons), which is neither what this
 * makes nor what lands on the map. The adding is said by the words beside it, there being no
 * note-and-plus in the icon set, and that leaves the mark unlike the + of the zoom step opposite.
 *
 * It stands on the map rather than in the note's own bar of actions, where it was: what it starts is
 * finished by a click on the map, so it belongs beside the canvas that answers it. In placement mode
 * the button is shown as pressed, and pressing it again turns placement mode off.
