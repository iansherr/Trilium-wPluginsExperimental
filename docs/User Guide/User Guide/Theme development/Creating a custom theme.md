# Creating a custom theme
## Step 1. Find a place to place the themes

Organization is an important aspect of managing a knowledge base. When developing a new theme or importing an existing one it's a good idea to keep them into one place.

As such, the first step is to create a new note to gather all the themes.

## Step 2. Create the theme

<table>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="Creating a custom theme_3_Creating a custom theme_im.png"></td>
            <td>Themes are code notes with a special attribute. Start by creating a new code note.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="Creating a custom theme_1_Creating a custom theme_im.png"></td>
            <td>Then change the note type to a CSS code.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td><img src="Creating a custom theme_Creating a custom theme_im.png"></td>
            <td>In the attributes of the note (the&nbsp;<span class="tn-icon bx bx-list-check"></span> button in the&nbsp;<a class="reference-link" href="../Basic%20Concepts%20and%20Features/UI%20Elements/Status%20bar.md">Status bar</a>), define the <code>#appTheme</code> attribute to point to any desired name. This is the name that will show up in the appearance section in settings.</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

## Step 3. Define the theme's CSS

As a very simple example we will change the background color of the launcher pane to a shade of blue.

To alter the different variables of the theme:

```css
:root {
	--launcher-pane-background-color: #0d6efd;
}
```

## Step 4. Activating the theme

Refresh the application (Ctrl+Shift+R is a good way to do so) and go to settings. You should see the newly created theme:

![](Creating%20a%20custom%20theme_2_Creating%20a%20custom%20theme_im.png)

Afterwards the application will refresh itself with the new theme:

![](Creating%20a%20custom%20theme_4_Creating%20a%20custom%20theme_im.png)

Do note that the theme will be based off of the legacy theme. To override that and base the theme on the Modern theme, see <a class="reference-link" href="Customize%20the%20Next%20theme.md">Customize the Next theme</a>.

## Step 5. Making changes

Simply go back to the note and change according to needs. To apply the changes to the current window, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>R</kbd> to refresh.

It's a good idea to keep two windows, one for editing and the other one for previewing the changes.
